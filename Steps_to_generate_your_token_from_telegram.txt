ðŸ¤– How to Create Your Own Bot Token on Telegram
Follow these simple steps to create a Telegram bot and get your token:

1. Open Telegram and Search for @BotFather
BotFather is the official bot to manage all Telegram bots.

It has a verified blue checkmark âœ….

2. Start a Chat with BotFather
Click Start or type /start to begin the conversation.

3. Create a New Bot
Send the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
/newbot
BotFather will ask for a name for your bot.

This is your botâ€™s display name (e.g., My Dummy Bot).

Then it will ask for a username.

This must end in bot (e.g., dummytestbot, dfordemobot).

4. Get Your Bot Token
Once your bot is created, BotFather will reply with a message like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/dfordemobot.
Use this token to access the HTTP API:
123456789:ABCdefGHI_jklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
Copy the token â€“ this is your API key to control the bot.

5. Add the Token to Your Script
Replace the TOKEN variable in your Python code with the one you just received:

python
Copy
Edit
TOKEN: final = "123456789:ABCdefGHI_jklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ"
âœ… Optional: Disable Privacy Mode (for Group Chats)
If you want your bot to respond to all messages in a group without needing to be mentioned:

Open @BotFather.

Send:

bash
Copy
Edit
/mybots
Select your bot â†’ Bot Settings â†’ Group Privacy.

Set it to Disabled.
